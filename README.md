## Welcome hackers! This project is a beginner-friendly initiative: a fun little ditty to help you get creative with open source. 
## Feel free to make a new feature/page and submit a pull request.

### This is my first Hacktoberfest, how do I get started?  :rocket:

- Have a look for issues labelled as 'good first issue', 'hacktoberfest', 'up-for-grabs', or 'first-timers-only'.
- Read the instructions in contributing.md
- Have fun creating something new!
